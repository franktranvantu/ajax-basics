There are two common methods for sending HTTP requests:

- GET. Used for most requests. Browser uses the GET method whenever it requests a new web page, CSS file, image, and so on. Use GET when you want to "get" something from the server.

- POST. Used frequently with web forms to send data to store in a database. Use POST when sending data that will store, delete or update information from a database.
