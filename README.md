In this section, we'll continue with our intranet project. 

Now that we have a JSON response from the server and parsed it, we need to turn it into HTML and add it to the web page.

2. Check the "inoffice" property
3. Get the value for the "name" property, insert it inside the `<li>` tag
4. Close the `<li>` tag
